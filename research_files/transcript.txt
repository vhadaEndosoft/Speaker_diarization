Hey, did you hear about the new policy change at work? 
Hasan 1 0:00:05
No, what's going on? 
Vishal 2 0:00:07
Starting next month, we can work from home two days a week. 
Hasan 1 0:00:11
That's awesome. I've been wanting more flexibility. 
Vishal 2 0:00:15
Me too. It's going to make balancing everything so much easier. 
Hasan 1 0:00:19
Absolutely. Plus, avoiding the commute twice a week will be great. 
Vishal 2 0:00:24
Totally. Let's plan to grab lunch on one of those home days. 
Hasan 1 0:00:28
Sounds like a plan. I'll look forward to it.
